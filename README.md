This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in COBOL programming: attempting to move alphanumeric data into a numeric field.  The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.cob` file shows the corrected version.  This often leads to unexpected program behavior or runtime exceptions.  Understanding data types is critical for writing reliable COBOL programs.
